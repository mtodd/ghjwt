# `ghjwt`

Simple CLI tool to quickly generate GitHub Apps authn/authz JWTs.

This is used to authenticate requests against the GitHub Apps endpoints:
https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/

Learn about how to authenticate for these endpoints, and how to use the JWT generated by this tool, here:
https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app

## Installation

``` shell
go get -u github.com/mtodd/ghjwt
```

## Usage

To generate a valid JWT authentication token, given your GitHub Apps ID is `1234` and the private key PEM file generated from your GitHub Apps' settings can be found at `path/to/private/key.pem`:

``` shell
ghjwt -iss 1234 -pem path/to/private/key.pem
```

This defaults to generating a valid token that expires 10 minutes from now. Use the `-dur` option to specify how long the JWT should be valid for, or set `-exp` with the specific unixtime expiration time for the key.

## Example

``` shell
jwt=$(ghjwt -iss 1234 -pem path/to/private/key/pem)
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $jwt" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json" https://api.github.com/app
```
